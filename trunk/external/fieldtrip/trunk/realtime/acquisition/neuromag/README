README file for neuromag2ft

The neuromag2ft relays the MEG data being acquired in the acquisition
computer to any computer in the network that hosts a Fieldtrip
buffer TCP server. Then, the user can read from this server using any
tools he/she wants. For more information on how to read from a
Fieldtrip buffer server, please check
http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/tutorial/realtime and
http://www.bci2000.org/wiki/index.php/Programming_Tutorial:Working_with_the_FieldTrip_buffer.

You'll need to download the open-source software Fieldtrip to run the
buffer server and to read from it. The software can be downloaded from
http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/download or, if you prefer to use a
subversion repository, get a local copy of the Fieldtrip repository
using

svn checkout http://fieldtrip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ fieldtrip-read-only

More information on how to run and compile neuromag2ft can be found at:
